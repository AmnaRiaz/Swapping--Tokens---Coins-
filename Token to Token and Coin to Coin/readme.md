ERC-20 Based Swapping
 Token to Token & Coin to Coin




What is Swapping ?
Swap is a token-to-token exchange. Swap allows users to easily exchange one token with another without leaving their explorer. 

Ethereum Token Swapping :

You can Swap your Tokens with another without going through several intermediaries, which will also cost gas fees. You can swap your TokenA with TokenB and also CoinA with CoinB.


Implementation:-

ERC20 Swapping :

Now, we are going to focus on creating a Swapping contract (ERC20 Based). As you know the ERC20 Token is an open zeppelin Standard. We are just using the Interface of deployed Staking Token () and Reflectionary/Reward Token as ER20-based Token.


NOTE:- We are using Interface in this Contract. You can learn about the Smart Contract Interface by providing the link (https://www.newline.co/courses/creating-an-erc20-token-on-ethereum/smart-contract-interfaces)


Now, we see the Read and Write functions of Static Staking on Remix Ide after compiling and deploying. And also can check on EtherScan Rinkeby Testnet at  given link (https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0x890f18294db1230089132843d7026671919e2a02#writeContract) of deployed contract.




Read Functions:-

1. Fee: This function returns the Taxation fee of this contract, which will be deducted on every transaction, when we swap token to token and coin to coin.That is by default is set 2 (2% in solidity).

2. owner: This function returns the address of the contract owner.

3. Token1: This function returns the address of the token1 or Coin1 as your input address of token or coin contract.

4. Token2: This function returns the address of the token2 or Coin2 as your input address of token or coin contract.

5. totalContractLiquidity : This function returns how much balance of the token1 or Coin1 & token2 or Coin2  is in the contract.


Write Functions:-

 1. setFee : You can change the fee by inputting a new fee value (uint). 

 2. tokenOrCoinAToB : You can Swap Token 1 or Coin 1 to Token 2 or Coin 2 with this function.As your inputting token or coin address. First, approve this contract the amount you want to swap. 

 3. tokenOrCoinBToA : You can Swap Token 2 or Coin 2 to Token 1 or Coin 1 with this function.As your inputting token or coin address. First, approve this contract the amount you want to swap. 

Deployment procedure:- ( Remix )

Deploying a Contract to Mainnet or Testnet Using Remix.
Step 1- Create a file in Remix with your project name. And paste your code. Select the correct compiler version.

Step 2- Navigate to the Compile sidebar option and press the Compile ERC20_StakinToken.sol button or just CTRL + S, it will compile your contract.

Step 3- Select your desired contract with a contract name from CONTRACT. 

Step 4- Now you can deploy the contract by navigating to the Deployment sidebar option. You need to change the topmost ENVIRONMENT dropdown from JavaScript VM to Injected Web3. This tells Remix to use the MetaMask injected provider, which will point it to your Mainnet or Testnet development node.
If you wanted to try this using another network, you would have to connect MetaMask to the correct network instead of your local development node.

As soon as you select Injected Web3, you will be prompted to allow Remix to connect to your MetaMask account. Press Next in MetaMask to allow Remix to access the selected account.

Step 5- Back on Remix, you should see that the account you wish to use for deployment is now managed by MetaMask. Select Deploy.

You will be prompted in MetaMask to confirm the contract deployment transaction.
After you press Confirm and the deployment is complete, you will see the transaction listed in MetaMask. The contract will appear under Deployed Contracts in Remix.

Usage Flow:-

Note:-  The crypto industry has said that the key distinction between coins and tokens is that crypto coins are the native asset of a Blockchain like Bitcoin or Ethereum, whereas crypto tokens are created by platforms and applications that are built on top of an existing Blockchain.

Deep dive into distinction between Token and Coin: https://blog.liquid.com/coin-vs-token 

Note:- If you want to Swapping between Coin1 and Coin2 you have to put the address in constructor of tokenSwap contract of deployed contract of coin1 and coin2, or you want to swap Token1 to Token2 you have to put deployed address of token1 and token2. All the functionality of Token and Coin are the same at all.  Difference is that coins are native assets of a Blockchain and tokens are built on top of an existing Blockchain. 

After deploying all three contracts e.g: tokenSwap_Contract , ERC20_TokenA & ERC20_TokenB .

Step 1: Transfer totalSupply (or how much total Swap_Supply you want to give) of TokenA or CoinA & TokenB or CoinB ( Make sure you give an equal amount of SwapSupply to the contract) to the tokenSwap contract.

Step 2: Approve the amount you want to swap from the TokenA or CoinA contract (if swapping Token AToB). Then swap that amount through tokenSwap contract.

Step 2: Approve the amount you want to swap from the TokenB or CoinB  contract (if swapping Token BToA). Then swap that amount through tokenSwap contract.

Changes:- 

Just change the fee variable value. Now it is 2, which means 2 %. 

Taxationâ€™s: The contract is deducting  taxations:-
Fee ( variable ): 2 % will be transferred in each transaction.






Disclaimer:-

This ERC-20-based Swapping smart contract was created for use in production-level blockchain applications and is thoroughly tested to the best of the developers' knowledge to work as intended.



That's it! you're done.
